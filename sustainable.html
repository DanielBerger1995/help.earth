                In this day and age we live such a fast paced lifestyle and we often don't find the time to be sustainable or let alone find out how to be.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, there are simple changes you can implement into your daily life that take little to no time or effort and can actually save you a lot of money in the process. Who says living greener has to be difficult.

            <h4>Recycle.</h4>
            <p>
                Okay let's start off with the basics, this one should be self explanatory. Just recycle when ever you have the chance, trust me its way better than what happens to trash at a landfill.
            </p>
            <br>
<div class="imges">

            <div class="photosource">Landfill site | Getty images</div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                But it is of up most importance that you sort your waste correctly! If done wrong, it's pretty much as bad if not worse than not recycling at all. Interested to know more or still got questions? Then read <a href="recycling.html">this article</a> for more information.

            <br>
            <h4>Conserve water.</h4>
            <p>


                So water, it's great isn't it. We all love swimming in our majestic seas or taking a relaxing, candle lit bath, actually water is so much around us it is easy to see why we take it for granted and forget that it is actually in limited supply.
                <br><br>
                Sure it isn't us the individuals who are the leading heads of water waste for that we would have to talk to the big companies.But we can and should all do our part to help out, just turn the tap off while brushing your teeth or when washing dishes and make sure your washing machine and dish washer are filled up to the brink (clothes don't understand the boundaries of personal space).
                <br>
                <br>
                For those off us who love gardening heres <a href="https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/tips-for-more-sustainable-garden.php">an article</a> which could help you be more sustainable with your water in the garden.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Conserve energy.</h4>

            <p>

                I know how we all love to be turned on all of the time (no pun intended), but just get used to turning things off.
                <br>
                <br>
                Make sure all appliances and lights are turned off when they aren't needed, forget your thermostat, put on another layer of clothes if you're getting too cold and have no one to cuddle up with and the same goes for using your air conditioner, maybe just crack a window open and enjoy the fresh air.

            <div class="photosource">Littered light bulbs | Martina Leitschuh</div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Yeah, I know bulbs can be really expensive but they are also extremely hard to recycle because of the chemicals contained within.

                So, instead of looking at the prices, try to buy energy efficient CFLs or LED bulbs. They will last up to 5 times longer and shine brighter than any regular bulb.

            </p>

            <h4>Save paper.</h4>
            <p>

                Welcome to future, need to write something down?
                Just pull out your digital device of choice and take some notes, trees are important, you know.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Save plastic.</h4>
            <p>

                Plastic, now here is a huge issue. It just never goes away!
                Today makes up for about 40 percent of the world’s ocean surfaces, now that's insane. Use reusable bags when you go shopping, buy a refillable water bottle and avoid products made from or packaged in plastic whenever possible and yes that includes online shopping.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Resell and donate items.</h4>
            <p>

                Don't be in a rush to throw away items you no longer need, you can grant them a second chance of life through resale or donation (I mean just look at Toy Story and how happy they were to get a new home).
                <br>
                <br>
                Try reselling clothing and children’s things through a secondhand store or consider donating them to a nonprofit or charity organization, to be later redistributed. Just because you have no use for it anymore doesn't mean it won't put a smile on the face of someone else more in need.


            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Travel green.</h4>
            <p>

                If you don't own a car then great! If you do, try cutting down on your use of it. Take public transport or better yet a relaxing bike ride or even walking, in addition to keeping you fit, it will help the environment and save you a lot of gas money as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now if you just love being behind the wheel (fast and furious hype), then car pool. Take some friends or colleagues with you, on your way there and back from your daily duties. There are many apps or websites available nowadays, that makes setting this up a piece of cake.

            <h4>Eat less meat.</h4>
            <p>


                Okay, I know this one may be hard for you carnivores out there, I admit I have my own hurdles to over come when it comes to cutting out meat. But that's the thing you don't have to stop completely, just maybe not everyday. Even omitting it from a meal one day a week can positively influence change.
                <br><br>
                According to a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2006/11/201222-rearing-cattle-produces-more-greenhouse-gases-driving-cars-un-report-warns#.U01SHahdURI">United Nations report</a>, “cattle-rearing generates more global warming greenhouse gases, as measured in CO2 equivalent, than transportation.

            </p>



            <br>
            <h4>Eat locally.</h4>
            <p>


                The convenience of supermarkets has changed how we as a people think about food. It has become so simple to walk 5 minutes to your nearest store and be able to buy any product at any time of year. But in truth these products have been flown in from all across the globe to be at your availability, just think about the amounts of fossil fuel energy wasted for a procedure that occurs on the daily.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the information above got you thinking about the subject, then how about giving your local farmers market a visit, come face to face with the actually people who provide your food.
            </p>
            <br>

            <img src="/images/farmersmarket.jpg" alt="" class="articleimg">

            <br>
            <p>
                Now if you're feeling extremely enthusiastic start gardening, you may be surprised at how easy it is to start a small garden that can produce a substantial amount of food for you.


            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Fair trade products.</h4>
            <p>

                Okay so this one might cost you a little more but hey, when it comes to our health of our home wouldn't you agree that its priceless. Also with all that money you have saved up on electricity bills, fossil fuels and water it kind of makes up for it, right?
                <br>
                <br>
                If you’re going to give brands your support through purchasing their products, make sure to read labels carefully. Look for beauty and cleaning products that are responsible in their production.
