         In this day and age we live such a fast paced lifestyle and we often don't find the time to be sustainable or let alone find out how to be.
<br>
<br>
However, there are small changes you can implement into your daily life that take little to no time or effort and can actually save you a lot of money in the process.
<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, you can be kind to the planet and stuff your wallet - without much effort at all. Adopting a greener approach to life doesn't have to be difficult.

         <h4>Recycle.</h4>
<p>
Okay let's start off with the basics, this one should be self explanatory. Just recycle when ever you have the chance, trust me its way better than what happens to trash at a landfill.

Oh yeah and if you are not sure about which bin your empty products belong,
(we have all been there) then be sure to check out this article, its extremely helpful!

     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Conserve water.</h4>
     <p>


So water, it's great isn't it. We all love swimming in oceans or taking a bath drinking water, actually water is so much around us it is easy to see why we take it so for granted and forget that it is actually in limited supply,

sure it isn't us the individuals who are the leading heads of water waste for that we would have to talk to the big companies. but we can all do our part to help out, just turn the tap off while brushing your teeth or when washing dishes and just fill up the washing machine with as much laundry at once same applies for the dish washer. avoid flushing anything that doesn't need to be there.

For those off us who love gardening heres an article which could help you be more sustainable with your water in the garden.

     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Conserve energy.</h4>

     <p>

I know how we all love to be turned on all of the time (no pun intended), but just get used to turning things off.

Make sure all appliances and lights are turned off when they aren't needed, forget your thermostat, put on another layer of clothes if you're getting too cold and have no one to cuddle up with and the same goes for using your air conditioner, maybe just crack a window open and enjoy the fresh air.

Try to switch your bulbs to energy-efficient compact fluorescent (CFLs) or LED bulbs. Though they may be a little more expensive, it’s worth it because they can last up to five times longer than regular light bulbs and are very bright so you won’t need to turn on as many lights.

     </p>

     <br>
     <h4>Save paper.</h4>
     <p>

Welcome to future, need to  write something down?
Just pull out your digital device of choice and take some notes, trees are important, you know.
</p>
<br>
 <h4>Save plastic.</h4>
<p>

Plastic, now here is a huge issue. It just never goes away!
Today makes up for about 40 percent of the world’s ocean surfaces, now that's insane. Use reusable bags when you go shopping, buy a refillable water bottle and avoid products made from or packaged in plastic whenever possible and yes that includes online shopping.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Eat less meat.</h4>
<p>


Okay, I know this one may be hard for you carnivores out there, I admit I have my own hurdles to over come when it comes to cutting out meat. But that's the thing you don't have to stop completely, just maybe not everyday. Even omitting it from a meal one day a week can positively influence change.

According to a United Nations report, “cattle-rearing generates more global warming greenhouse gases, as measured in CO2 equivalent, than transportation.

     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Fair trade products.</h4>
     <p>

Okay so this one might cost you a little more but hey, when it comes to our health of our home wouldn't you agree that its priceless. Also with all that money you have saved up on electricity bills, fossil fuels and water it kind of makes up for it, right?

If you’re going to give brands you’re support through purchasing their products, read labels carefully. Look for beauty and cleaning products brands that are responsible in their production, looking for responsible brand seals.

Check out this site, where you can find a list of eco-friendly product labels and logos.


     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Travel green.</h4>
     <p>

In addition to helping you live a healthier lifestyle, trying to cut down on driving can help the environment and save you a lot of gas money as well.


     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Resell and donate items.</h4>
     <p>

Items that you no longer need can get an extended life through resale and donation. By extending the life of any product, you help reduce dependence on disposable or cheaply made single-use products that end up in landfills.

Try reselling clothing and children’s things through a secondhand or consignment retailer or consider donating them to a nonprofit resale organization (such as Goodwill) or charity organization (such as the Salvation Army or American Cancer Society) that will redistribute them to those in need.

     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Eat locally.</h4>
     <p>


A powerful way to live more sustainably is to eat locally. The convenience of supermarkets has changed how people think about food. You can stroll through aisles stocked with fruits, vegetables, and other products from all over the world any time of year. But these products consume huge amounts of fossil fuel energy to get from those global locations to your corner supermarket.
